        <div>
          Mentor was a character in Homer's Odyssey, portrayed as an old friend
          of Ulysses, who guided young Telemachus to look for his father. It is
          assumed the goddess Athena was the real Mentor, changing forms not to
          be recognizable. During the ten-year Trojan War, Odysseus, the king of
          Ithaca, left his wife Penelope and his son Telemachus to lead his
          army. Odysseus placed Telemachus under the care of a guardian called
          Mentor, whose job it was to protect and guide him.
