                            <div class="block">Mentor was a character in Homer's Odyssey, portrayed as an old friend of
                                Ulysses, who guided young Telemachus to look for his father. It is assumed the goddess
                                Athena was the real Mentor, changing forms not to be recognizable.
                                During the ten-year Trojan War, Odysseus, the king of Ithaca, left his wife Penelope and
                                his son Telemachus to lead his army.
                                Odysseus placed Telemachus under the care of a guardian called Mentor, whose job it was
                                to protect and guide him.
