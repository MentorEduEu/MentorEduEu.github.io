                                    <div class="content">Belgrade (Beograd) is the capital of Serbia, and has a
                                        population of around 1.6 million. It is situated in South-Eastern Europe, on the
                                        Balkan Peninsula, at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. It is one of
                                        the oldest cities in Europe and since ancient times has been an important focal
                                        point for traffic, an intersection of the roads of Eastern and Western Europe.
                                        As a result of its tumultuous history, Belgrade has for centuries been home to
                                        many nationalities, with Serbs of the Orthodox Christian religion making up the
                                        majority of the population. The official language is Serbian. Dva pisma
                                        For an urban metropolis, Belgrade is a very safe city. Pickpocketing is also not
                                        as ubiquitous as in more touristy capitals of Europe, but common sense should be
                                        exercised and due vigilance maintained especially in crowded places.
                                        You will find a large selection of restaurants, bars, shops and bookstores. It
                                        won't take you long to figure out that the people of Belgrade love to eat and to
                                        party.
                                        The official currency in Serbia is dinar, abbreviated RSD. Money may be
                                        exchanged in all banks and post offices, as well as in authorized exchange
                                        offices.
                                        Tap water in Belgrade is safe to drink.
